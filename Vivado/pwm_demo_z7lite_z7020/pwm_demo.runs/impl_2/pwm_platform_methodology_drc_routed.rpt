2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.043 ns between sin_input_7_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_mmcm_1) and centered_pwm_1channel/pwm_reg/D (clocked by clk_mmcm_2). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.082 ns between sinegen/U0/i_synth/i_dds/I_SINCOS.i_std_rom.i_rom/i_rtl.i_quarter_table.i_piped_map.i_cardinal_sin_ls/opt_has_pipe.first_q_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_mmcm_2) and sin_input_reg[11]/D (clocked by clk_mmcm_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.145 ns between sinegen/U0/i_synth/i_dds/I_SINCOS.i_std_rom.i_rom/i_rtl.i_quarter_table.i_piped_map.i_cardinal_sin_ls/opt_has_pipe.first_q_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_mmcm_2) and sin_input_reg[12]/D (clocked by clk_mmcm_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.198 ns between sinegen/U0/i_synth/i_dds/I_SINCOS.i_std_rom.i_rom/i_rtl.i_quarter_table.i_piped_map.i_cardinal_sin_ms/opt_has_pipe.first_q_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_mmcm_2) and sin_input_reg[13]/D (clocked by clk_mmcm_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.277 ns between sinegen/U0/i_synth/i_dds/I_SINCOS.i_std_rom.i_rom/i_rtl.i_quarter_table.i_piped_map.i_cardinal_sin_ms/opt_has_pipe.first_q_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_mmcm_2) and sin_input_reg[14]/D (clocked by clk_mmcm_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.827 ns between sinegen/U0/i_synth/i_dds/I_SINCOS.i_std_rom.i_rom/i_rtl.i_quarter_table.i_piped_map.i_cardinal_sin_ls/opt_has_pipe.first_q_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_mmcm_2) and sin_input_reg[9]/D (clocked by clk_mmcm_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
